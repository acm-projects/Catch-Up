<h1 align="center"> Catch-Up </h1>

<div align="center"> Do you feel like you‚Äôre losing touch with your friends? Or want to meet up but can never find the time? This app helps you catch up with friends, both old and new! Each user in a group can record videos and voice notes. At a chosen time, these clips will compile into a vlog style movie allowing you to relive everyone‚Äôs day together. </div>


## MVP üí∞

 -  User Account
	 - user authentication with username and password
	 - personalization - ex: profile photo
 - Groups
	 - choose who to share with 
 -   Ability to record and upload moments
	 - Record video through the app
	 - Record voice notes through the app
 - Publish the movie
	 - all recorded clips from the group should merge into a viewable movie by the end of the day
	 - publish for only 24 hours and then make it disappear

## Stretch Goals üôÜ
- Generate prompts as conversation starters 
	- Ex: record something that reminds you of (user_in_the_group)
- Display fun statistics 
	- Streak of the # of days you've recorded in a row 
	- Minutes recorded etc.
-   Add personalization for each group such as colors or themes
-   Implement in-app messaging to discuss the day with the group
